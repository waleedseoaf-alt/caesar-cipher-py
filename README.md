# Caesar Cipher Project 🔐

Welcome to my repository! I am a Python student currently based in **Turkey**. This project is a milestone in my programming journey, created in **February 2026**. I am sharing it exactly as I wrote it to document my progress and show my real learning path.

## 🧠 What I Learned in This Project
The biggest achievement in this code was mastering **Functions** using the `def` keyword.
- I learned how to encapsulate logic inside a `def` block to make the code reusable, organized, and much cleaner.
- I practiced passing parameters into functions and understanding how to structure a program's flow more professionally.
- I deepened my understanding of the modulo operator `%` to create a circular shift for the alphabet.

## 🚀 About the Code
This script encrypts messages by shifting letters based on a user-defined number.
I intentionally kept the code "human" and simple, just the way I first wrote it. This allows me to look back in the future and see how much I have improved as I continue my Python journey.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The program asks the user for a message.
2. The user enters a shift number.
3. The program outputs the encrypted text.
